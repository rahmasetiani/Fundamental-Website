# Fundamental-Website

This repository contains the fundamental elements for creating a website from scratch. It covers the basic structure, styling, and interactivity needed for building a responsive and functional website.

## Features

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Defines the structure and content of the website. Each section, paragraph, and media (images, videos, etc.) is organized using semantic HTML elements.
  
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Provides the styling, layout, and appearance for the website. CSS is used to add colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive design principles, ensuring the website works well on different screen sizes.
  
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and functionality. JavaScript is used to implement dynamic elements like form validation, content updates without page reloads (AJAX), and more.
  
- **Bootstrap 5**: A CSS framework used to simplify responsive design and layout creation, making the website mobile-friendly with built-in components like navigation bars, buttons, and forms.
